# Intro to problem solving

1. We use problem solving every day in our daily life
2. We also need to use problem solving often in our software engineering life

## Problem solving in daily life

- Searching for a word in a dictionary (Binary search)
- When we are travelling somewhere, we try to find the shortest path to our destination

## Problem solving in software engineering

- Searching in Amazon. As we search, we get suggestions. If we type "iph", we need to search they letters amongst millions or billions of products
- We can also here products here by price, popularity. Sorting is also an algorithm problem
- Finding the quickest or the shortest path for delivering products

## Observation

Let's look at finding the sum of numbers 1 to 100
- We can start counting one by one from 1 all the way to 100 but if we observe, we can see a pattern where can pair these numbers

```js
1 + 99 = 101
2 + 98 = 101
3 + 98 = 101
4 + 97 = 101
```
and there would 50 such pairs. So the sum can easily be found by doing `50 * 101`. 
Observing and identifiying the pattern is what helped us optimise our solution.

This repo/notes is basically me researching these problems, patterns and solutions
