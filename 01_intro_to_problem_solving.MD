# Intro to problem solving

1. We use problem solving every day in our daily life
2. We also need to use problem solving often in our software engineering life

## Problem solving in daily life

- Searching for a word in a dictionary (Binary search)
- When we are travelling somewhere, we try to find the shortest path to our destination

## Problem solving in software engineering

- Searching in Amazon. As we search, we get suggestions. If we type "iph", we need to search they letters amongst millions or billions of products
- We can also here products here by price, popularity. Sorting is also an algorithm problem
- Finding the quickest or the shortest path for delivering products
